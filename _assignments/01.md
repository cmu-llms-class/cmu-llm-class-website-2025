In this homework, you will investigate existing pre-training datasets. Then, you will replicate a data pre-processing pipeline that converts raw web-crawled data into a cleaned dataset that is easy and efficient to train on.
Through this homework, you will explore (a) attributes of large scale pre-training datasets and their properties [*Problem 1*] (b) different steps involved in cleaning, reducing, diversifying [*Problem 2.1-2.2*] and de-duplicating pretraining data [*Problem 2.3*] and finally, (d) converting it into a standardized format for improved use in pre-training [*Problem 2.4*]. 
You should submit to GradeScope your code for `mini_ccc.py` and `homework.py` as well as a `report.pdf` with your answers to each of the deliverables.
