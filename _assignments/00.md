Submit your 12-digit AWS ID using [this form](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSfVLq_qM1o_-XTEq1C6-mI9UJEXxDQe09XpWa-c8pkYWo4p7A/viewform?usp=header).

You should use your Andrew email address to create your AWS account. You will need to submit the 12-digit AWS Account ID. AWS will add the credit into your account directly in 2-3 weeks. You *must* have a US-based address for your account and you must provide a valid 12-digit AWS ID.  If not, AWS will not be able to add credit to your AWS account.

Your AWS account will be able to provision up to 64 vcpus for all AWS instance types including GPUs. You can use the following directions to view your credit: [The Startup Quick Guide to Managing Budgets, Credits, and AWS Resources (amazon.com)](https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/startups/how-to-set-aws-budget-when-paying-with-aws-credits/)

If you overspend or your account gets compromised before a billing cycle (end of the month), you are expected to submit a billing support case ID with AWS Customer Service ASAP and ask for a billing adjustment.  The decision to approve the billing adjustment is only with AWS Customer Service.  If a billing cycle has passed, you will be responsible to pay the overspent amount.
